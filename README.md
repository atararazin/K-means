# k-means

This program is an implementation of the k-means algorithm.

I run it for 20 iterations (you can change this by changing the parameter ```NUM_ITERATIONS```). After eaach iteration, a graphical visualization should come up, with the red dots being the points and the blue dots being the centriods.

That way, you can watch how the centriods change over time.


Finally, the program outputs a graph, visualizing the loss' change over time.
